# Web-Based Caesar Cipher Game with Flask (Python)

### The Caesar Cipher game is a fun and educational game that involves encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest known encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar, who used it to secure his military communications.

### In the game, players are presented with a message that has been encrypted using the Caesar Cipher. The encryption process involves shifting each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, if the shift value is 3, 'A' would be encrypted as 'D', 'B' as 'E', and so on.

### The objective of the game is to decrypt the encrypted message by trying different shift values until the original message is revealed. Players can interact with the game by inputting the shift value and seeing the decrypted message. The game can also provide hints or additional challenges to make it more engaging.

### Implementing the Caesar Cipher game using Flask and Python allows you to create a web-based version where players can access and play the game through a web browser. Flask is a popular web framework in Python that makes it easy to build web applications. You can use Flask to handle the game logic, web interface, and communication between the player and the server.

### By combining the Caesar Cipher algorithm, the game mechanics, and the web technology provided by Flask, you can create an interactive and enjoyable learning experience for players to explore encryption and decryption concepts while having fun solving puzzles.

Encode or Decode option specifies whether user wants to encode something or decode something.

Message is the text which will be encoded by the algorithm.

Shift number is like the secret key which encodes or decodes the message.

At the end when user clicks the Submit button, user receives a string containing the encoded/decoded message.
